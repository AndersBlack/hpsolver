The goal of this thesis is to explore the branch of artificial intelligence known as planning. Planning consists of formalistic descriptions of a state, where predicates describes an initial state and a set of possible actions, which changes the state. The purpose is to describe a sequence of actions to go from the initial state to reach the goal state. Planning is used in areas such as logistics, coordination and scheduling. 
The project intends to begin with the subcategory called hierarchical planning. Hierarchical planning divides a larger planning problem into sub-problems and then solves a section of the problem first in order to isolate the needed actions for the particular sub-problem. 
The initial goal is to create an application that is able to solve generic hierarchical planning problems using the HDDL (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05499) format. The solver will then be compared to the time of the solvers from the last IPC competition (https://ipc2023-htn.github.io/).
If time allows, we would also like to explore other approaches to planning, such as allowing resource constraints, probabilistic planning and conditional planning.
